# Android-11-settings-greyed-out
I've had settings greyed out consistently with both android 11 and ios and many issues with obvious intrusion onto my device.. I am a newb when it comes to coding although I find it very fascinating and would love to learn more, the truth is the truth. I've been dealing with very obvious hacks for a long time. So my current settings version is the following: Settings version 310280GID1-53FF-300377200.300377200. Is this consistent with what should be on my Moto Ace 5G? I upgraded to 11. Please help me out and let me know.  I am desperate and need you guys!!! Thanks let me know!
